Ameloblastomas are benign but locally aggressive odontogenic tumors that often present as asymptomatic swellings, primarily affecting the mandible, especially in the posterior region and ramus. These lesions can vary in size, with smaller ones showing unilocular radiolucency progressing to multilocular patterns resembling soap bubbles or honeycombs. Ameloblastomas are known to displace and resorb adjacent teeth, cause bone expansion, and lead to cortical plate destruction. Recurrence risks are associated with incomplete removal of the lesion in cases like these.

      "A 14-year-old non-black female presented with an asymptomatic lesion in the molar region of the mandible, measuring less than 2 cm in size. The radiographic features revealed a central origin of the lesion with defined but non-corticated borders, appearing as unilocular and radiolucent. There was no association noted with any teeth, and no signs of root resorption, tooth displacement, or impaction were observed. The lesion did not extend to the bony cortex. \n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the contextual information provided, the features of the described lesion align closely with a cementoma (periapical cemental dysplasia) in its second stage. This type of lesion is commonly found in the periapical region of lower incisors, predominantly in middle-aged women of black origin. However, it can occur in non-black individuals as well. Cementomas are usually asymptomatic and typically involve adjacent teeth with vital pulps, without causing displacement or resorption. The maximum diameter of such lesions does not exceed 1.5 cm.\n",

      "Considering the characteristics described, this presentation aligns closely with a central giant cell granuloma, a reactive lesion commonly observed in the mandibular body, typically found in young adults. This lesion, while originating centrally, can evolve from being unilocular to multilocular with irregular and ill-defined borders as it grows. It can lead to bone expansion and facial swelling, potentially causing displacement, resorption, or loss of lamina dura in adjacent teeth. However, since the patient is asymptomatic and lacks pain or significant expansion to the bony cortex, it may signify an early or less aggressive stage of the lesion.\n",
