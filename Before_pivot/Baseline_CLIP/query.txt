It  is  an  odontogenic  inflammatory  cyst  associated  with  the  apex  of   a  tooth  with 
nonvital pulp.It originates from  epithelial cells  of Malassez  locating in the periodontal 
ligament of a nonvital tooth. The epithelial cells under stimulation by the inflammatory 
products proliferate resulting in cystic degeneration. It is the most common cyst that 
develops in the jaws (55% to 70% of al cystic lesions).  Itâ€™s greater dimension usually 
does not exceed 1.5-2 cm, but there are cases where it may reach up to 5 cm. It has a 
similar  radiographic  appearance  to  the  periapical  granuloma,  but  is  larger  in  size. 
Radiographically appears as  a well-defined radiolucency and most often is surrounded 
by a  sclerotic border. Large radicular cysts may cause expansion, thinning and possibly 
perforation   of  the  cortical  plates  of  the  jaws.  The  apical  portion  of  the  tooth  enters 
the  radiolucency  and  loss  of  the  lamina  dura  is  observed.  In  large  radicular  cysts 
displacement and resorption of the roots of the adjacent teeth may be apparent.
