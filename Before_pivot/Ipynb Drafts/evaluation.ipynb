Developmental AnomaliesFordyce's GranulesFordyce's granules are a developmental anomalycharacterized by collections of heterotopic seba-ceous glands in the oral mucosa. Clinically, thereare many small, slightly raised whitish-yellowspots that are well circumscribed and rarelycoalesce, forming plaques (Fig. 4). They occurmost often in the mucosal surface of the upper lip,commissures, and the buccal mucosa adjacent tothe molar teeth in a symmetrical bilateral pattern.They are a frequent finding in about 80% ofpersons of both sexes. These granules are asymp-tomatic and come to the patient's attention bychance. With advancing age, they may becomemore prominent but should not be a cause forconcern.The differential diagnosis includes lichen planus,candidosis, and leukoplakia.Laboratory test.Histopathologic examinationsupports the clinical diagnosis.Treatment. Surgical removal is recommended.Congenital Lip PitsCongenital lip pits represent a rare developmentalmalformation that may occur alone or in combina-tion with commissural pits, cleft lip, or cleftpalate. Clinically, they present as bilateral orunilateral depressions at the vermilion border ofthe lower lip (Fig. 6). A small amount of mucoussecretion may accumulate at the depth of the pit.The lip may be enlarged and swollen.Treatment of choice is surgical excision, but onlyfor esthetic purposes.Treatment. No treatment is required.Oral HairHair and hair follicles are extremely unusualwithin the oral cavity. Only five cases have beenreported so far. There is no satisfactory explana-tion for the occurrence of oral hair although adevelopmental anomaly is the most likely possibil-ity.

Developmental AnomaliesFig. 7. Ankyloglossia.AnkyloglossiaCleft PalateAnkyloglossia, or tongue-tie, is a rare develop-mental disturbance in which the lingual frenum isshort or is attached close to the tip of the tongue(Fig. 7). In these cases the frenum is often thickand fibrous. Rarely, the condition may occur as aresult of fusion between the tongue and the floorof the mouth or the alveolar mucosa. The malfor-mation may cause speech difficulties.Treatment. Surgical clipping of the frenum cor-rects the problem.Cleft LipCleft palate is a developmental malformation dueto failure of the two embryonic palatal processesto fuse. The cause remains unknown, althoughheredity may play a role. Clinically, the patientsexhibit a defect at the midline of the palate thatmay vary in severity (Fig. 9). Bifid uvula repre-sents a minor expression of cleft palate and maybe seen alone or in combination with more severemalformations (Fig. 10).Cleft palate may occur alone or in combinationwith cleft lip. The incidence of cleft palate alonevaries between 0.29 and 0.56 per 1000 births. Itmay occur in the hard or soft palate or both.Serious speech, feeding, and psychologic prob-lems may occur.Cleft lip is a developmental malformation thatusually involves the upper lip and very rarely thelower lip (Fig. 8). It frequently coexists with cleftpalate and it rarely occurs alone. The incidence ofcleft lip alone or in combination with cleft palatevaries from 0.52 to 1.34 per 1000 births.The disorder may be unilateral or bilateral,complete or incomplete.Treatment.

Ankyloglossia.AnkyloglossiaCleft PalateAnkyloglossia, or tongue-tie, is a rare develop-mental disturbance in which the lingual frenum isshort or is attached close to the tip of the tongue(Fig. 7). In these cases the frenum is often thickand fibrous. Rarely, the condition may occur as aresult of fusion between the tongue and the floorof the mouth or the alveolar mucosa. The malfor-mation may cause speech difficulties.Treatment. Surgical clipping of the frenum cor-rects the problem.Cleft LipCleft palate is a developmental malformation dueto failure of the two embryonic palatal processesto fuse. The cause remains unknown, althoughheredity may play a role. Clinically, the patientsexhibit a defect at the midline of the palate thatmay vary in severity (Fig. 9). Bifid uvula repre-sents a minor expression of cleft palate and maybe seen alone or in combination with more severemalformations (Fig. 10).Cleft palate may occur alone or in combinationwith cleft lip. The incidence of cleft palate alonevaries between 0.29 and 0.56 per 1000 births. Itmay occur in the hard or soft palate or both.Serious speech, feeding, and psychologic prob-lems may occur.Cleft lip is a developmental malformation thatusually involves the upper lip and very rarely thelower lip (Fig. 8). It frequently coexists with cleftpalate and it rarely occurs alone. The incidence ofcleft lip alone or in combination with cleft palatevaries from 0.52 to 1.34 per 1000 births.The disorder may be unilateral or bilateral,complete or incomplete.Treatment. Plastic surgery as early as possiblecorrects the esthetic and functional problems.Treatment. Early surgical correction is recom-mended.--- Page 5 ---2. Developmental Anomalies7Fig. 8.

The patientsare usually anxious and nervous. The presence oforal hair and hair follicles may offer an explana-tion for the rare occurrence of keratoacanthomaintraorally.The differential diagnosis should be made fromtraumatically implanted hair and the presence ofhair in skin grafts after surgical procedures in theoral cavity.4--- Page 3 ---2.

Ankyloglossia.AnkyloglossiaCleft PalateAnkyloglossia, or tongue-tie, is a rare develop-mental disturbance in which the lingual frenum isshort or is attached close to the tip of the tongue(Fig. 7). In these cases the frenum is often thickand fibrous. Rarely, the condition may occur as aresult of fusion between the tongue and the floorof the mouth or the alveolar mucosa. The malfor-mation may cause speech difficulties.Treatment. Surgical clipping of the frenum cor-rects the problem.Cleft LipCleft palate is a developmental malformation dueto failure of the two embryonic palatal processesto fuse. The cause remains unknown, althoughheredity may play a role. Clinically, the patientsexhibit a defect at the midline of the palate thatmay vary in severity (Fig. 9). Bifid uvula repre-sents a minor expression of cleft palate and maybe seen alone or in combination with more severemalformations (Fig. 10).Cleft palate may occur alone or in combinationwith cleft lip. The incidence of cleft palate alonevaries between 0.29 and 0.56 per 1000 births. Itmay occur in the hard or soft palate or both.Serious speech, feeding, and psychologic prob-lems may occur.Cleft lip is a developmental malformation thatusually involves the upper lip and very rarely thelower lip (Fig. 8). It frequently coexists with cleftpalate and it rarely occurs alone. The incidence ofcleft lip alone or in combination with cleft palatevaries from 0.52 to 1.34 per 1000 births.The disorder may be unilateral or bilateral,complete or incomplete.Treatment. Plastic surgery as early as possiblecorrects the esthetic and functional problems.Treatment. Early surgical correction is recom-mended.--- Page 5 ---2. Developmental Anomalies7Fig. 8.
